EPS Contracts is the core solidity library for the Eternal Proxy Service

All the EPS contracts are published as and npm module at `@epsproxy/contracts.`

    import {
      EPS
    } from '@epsproxy/contracts'`

This is how to import the EPS interface in solidity:

    import '@epsproxy/contracts/EPS.sol';
